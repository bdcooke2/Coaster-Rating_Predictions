# Coaster Rating Predictions

Background: 

Captain Coaster holds a roller coaster rating / ranking system on its website. The system bases its rankings on a pairwise system where members of the public can rank roller coasters they have experienced around the world. Depending on their rankings, along with the rest of the public, a score is given to each coaster, indicating the percentage of "duals" it has won against other coasters in rankings lists. For the sake of this analytics project, I used these scores as the ratings for each coaster.
